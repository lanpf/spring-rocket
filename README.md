# spring-rocket
The Spring for Apache RocketMQ (spring-rocket) project applies core Spring concepts to the development of rocketMQ-based messaging solutions. It provides a "template" as a high-level abstraction for sending messages. It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with @RocketListener annotations and a "listener container".
